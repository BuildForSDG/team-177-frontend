[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/640b8dcf41d64f8e94cffb399af089df)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/BuildForSDG/team-177-frontend?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=BuildForSDG/team-177-frontend&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)


## About

We seek to connect stakeholders in the legal, legislative, administrative and financial fields to the most poverty-stricken in our society by coalescing them in one platform, making it easier for knowledge to flow while preventing, tracking and reporting abuse of rights. 

## Why

We try to address the first SDG goal, No Poverty, by leveraging our country's high internet and smartphone penetration rate, to
spread rights awareness, which an absence of leads to people being taken advantage of and missing out on opportunities to grow
themselves, due to lack of knowledge or a loss of access to information. This is our way of doing our part, striving to
alleviate poverty.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
